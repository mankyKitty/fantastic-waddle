# Generative Art Experiment

![image](imgs/screen1.png)

Inspired by [Xavier Ho's presentation at 2018 Lambda Jam](http://lambdajam.yowconference.com.au/proposal/?id=6175), and [this article by Benjamin Kovach](https://www.kovach.me/posts/2018-03-07-generating-art.html), this repo contains a demonstration of the new [reflex-dom-svg](https://github.com/qfpl/reflex-dom-svg/) and [reflex-dom-canvas](https://github.com/qfpl/reflex-dom-canvas/) libraries.

This is all built using [nix] and the [obelisk] builder from [obsidian systems]. This repo is in a high state of flux and is heavily influencing further development of the aforementioned libraries. It is part show-case, part testing, and part cookbook.
